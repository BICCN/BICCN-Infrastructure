Paste in the template and edit as needed.  
Here is a [markdown cheatsheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) as a formatting reference. You can click on the "Preview" or "Preview changes" tab as needed to see the formatting rendered. To continue editing simply click back on the "<> Edit file" tab.  
Save at the bottom of the page by making a commit (feel free to do this as needed).
