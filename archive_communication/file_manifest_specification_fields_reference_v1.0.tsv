Name of field	Machine-friendly name	Requirement	Description of intended string contents
Asset ID	asset_id	Required	"This digital asset identifier is preferably an archive-specific, archive-issued identifier, suitable for circulation."
Project ID	project_id	Optional (recommended if Sample ID present)	"This identifier is preferably an archive-specific, archive-issued identifier, suitable for circulation, that identifies a logical unit similar to a ""project"", ""dataset"", or ""data collection"", whatever such unit is most readily available from the point of view of the archive. Ideally this string is textual and somewhat human-readable, as opposed to numeric or hash-like. This field is optional to allow for the usage of this field as a convenience of data organization, in case it is helpful for the maintainer. A full account of asset-to-""project"" relationships (and other ""project"" information) is considered out of scope for this specification."
Asset name	asset_name	Optional	"This should ideally be the file's basename (i.e. without path information, but with file extension if this extension is part of the filename). This field is optional to allow for the case that the archive and/or data submitter deems the values to be unsuitable for circulation, either because they are subject to change, or because no canonical name exists in the filesystem of storage, or for any other reason."
Sample ID	sample_id	Optional	"This identifier should identify a biological specimen that the file record is about, at whatever granularity the data submitter cares to provide, within the namespace defined by the Project ID value (which must therefore be provided, whenever Sample ID is provided). Note that specification of this granularity (e.g. cell, brain, organism) is the purview of a sample or specimen manifest, not this manifest. Usage of this field ideally implies that the Project ID provides enough information to identify a group of people (e.g. a lab's members), some subset of which were responsible for the generation of these Sample ID values."
Public availability	public_availability	Optional	"An indication of the degree of public availability the data submitter and archive intend for the asset. Most commonly, this value will be ""Public"", but archive- and project-specific special cases may be indicated by alternatives like ""Private"", ""Controlled access by ...""."
URI	uri	Optional	"An identifier uniquely identifying the record (digital asset) using the syntactic conventions of a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). In particular, the identifier should most likely begin with https://dandiarchive.org/, https://nemoarchive.org/, or https://www.brainimagelibrary.org/ or similar. General URI and URL specifications can be found in RFC 3986."
URL	url	"Required if ""URL direct"" is not provided"	An internet-resolvable Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that retrieves a document which provides precise instructions for the user to obtain the asset (or otherwise redirects the client to such a document; see HTTP status codes 303 and 307).
URL direct	url_direct	"Required if ""URL"" is not provided"	"An internet-resolvable Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that retrieves a document which is an exact representation of the digital asset. Although this field theoretically enables programmatic access to raw assets, extensive such use is not recommended. Instead, a future system and specification should be used which is specifically designed to support such programmatic access (especially to satisfy bulk requests)."
Data type	data_type	Required	"A relatively free-form string describing the data type of the asset. For example, ""SAM file -- Sequence Alignment Map"". More detail should be included commensurate with feasibility and disambiguation utility. For example, there are non-interoperable variants of SWC neuron reconstruction files which ought to be disambiguated here if it is feasible to do so."
Checksum	checksum	Required	"The value of this field should be the hash of the byte string representing the contents of the file, with respect to the checksum scheme named in the Checksum scheme field. Use the ASCII representation of this checksum which is standard for that scheme (e.g. for SHA256, a 64-character lowercase alphanumeric string)."
Checksum scheme	checksum_scheme	Required	"Indication of the cryptographic hashing scheme used to verify the integrity of the asset. Most likely ""SHA256"" or ""MD5"". Alternatives may be used according to need."
Size	size	Required	The value of this field should be the decimal-formatted integer number of bytes in the byte string representation of the file.
