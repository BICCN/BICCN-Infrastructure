## Definitions [Optional]
Define entity specific terminology to ensure that your charter is comprehensible to new community members.
- OSDF - Open Science Data Framework architecture

## Objectives
Describe the incremental, observable, and measurable high-level outcomes this entity will provide to the BICCN.

The NeMO Archive encompasses the following data types:
- Genomic regions associated with brain abnormalities and disease
- Transcription factor binding sites and other regulatory elements
- Transcription activity
- Levels of cytosine modification
- Histone modification profiles and chromatin accessibility

By containing knowledge from varied sources in one resource, we allow traversal between datatypes based on common metadata.

Our specific stated aims are:
- Aim 1. Establish the Neuroscience Multi-Omic (NeMO) Data Store, encompassing data ingestion, and identification and development of controlled vocabularies & ontologies, working closely with the BD2K working groups and others to encourage the use of established standards commonly used for omics data; provision of stable and unique identifiers; and data storage and integration, utilizing OSDF.
-Aim 2. Perform Data Processing, from quality control processing through analysis pipelines, and promote accessibility of public and controlled datasets as well as standard operating procedures and documentation through the NeMO website and NeMO data portal.
-Aim 3. Provide Resources for Users to Engage in Analysis and Visualization, by performing continuous use case review and development, enabling analysis and data visualization for individual users, and enabling appropriate data nad analysis access to the BRAIN Initiative Analysis centers
