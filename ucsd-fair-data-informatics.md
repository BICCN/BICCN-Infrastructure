# UCSD Fair Data Informatics Lab - Neuroscience Information Framework
## Description
The University of California, San Diego (UCSD) Fair Data and Informatics Laboratory (FDI Lab) supports open science and is 
home to the Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF). NIF has extensive experience in community
engagement, collaborative standards building, effective processes for sharing, federating, and
integrating neuroscience data, information, and knowledge.

# Roles
[Principal Investigator] Maryann Martone (maryann@ncmir.ucsd.edu)   
[Co-Investigator] Jeffrey Grethe (jgrethe@ncmir.ucsd.edu)   
[Co-Investigator] Anita Bandrowski (abandrowski@ncmir.ucsd.edu)  
[Knowledge Engineer] Tom Gillespie (tom.h.gillespie@gmail.com)   

## Definitions [Optional]
* __NIFSTD__ Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF) Standard ontology (NIFSTD) is a neuroscience
  ontology that maintains an extensive set of terms and concepts important for the domains of
  neuroscience and biology.
* __InterLex__ A dynamic lexicon of biomedical terms built on the foundation of NeuroLex

## Objectives
* Develop a semantic framework for annotating and organizing cell level data by maturing community
  efforts to create a phenotype-based nervous system cell type ontology and phenotype representation
* Work with the community to develop and implement spatial and semantic standards for managing
  heterogeneous brain cell census data types

## In-scope
* Create an effective strategy for semantic modeling and classifying neurons
* Create a comprehensive ontology that represents canonical types (e.g., Purkinje cell),
  cell classes (e.g., GABAergic neurons) and individuals (Cell X from laboratory Y) based
  on neuronal properties and phenotypes.
* Establish a community platform for consortium members and beyond to easily view the ontology and
  to recommend and provide feedback on terms in the ontology.
* Provide the neuron ontology and other NIF ontologies covering additional relevant domains, e.g.,
  small molecules, subcellular structures, anatomical structures, techniques, via our open-source
  terminology/ontology service SciGraph
* Work with the BICCN community to help ensure that infrastructure and tools conform to best
  practices for making data FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable

## Out-of-scope
* TBD

## Github repositories
[NIF Ontology](https://github.com/SciCrunch/NIF-Ontology)   
Repository for the Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF) Standard ontology (NIFSTD). NIFSTD is a
neuroscience ontology that maintains an extensive set of terms and concepts important for the
domains of neuroscience and biology.

[pyontutils](https://github.com/tgbugs/pyontutils)   
Python utilities for working with ontologies

[SciGraph](https://github.com/SciGraph/SciGraph)   
SciGraph aims to represent ontologies and data described using ontologies as a Neo4j graph. SciGraph
reads ontologies with owlapi and ingests ontology formats available to owlapi (OWL, RDF, OBO, TTL,
etc).

## Documentation
[NIF Ontology Documentation](http://ontology.neuinfo.org/docs/)   
Documentation for the NIF Ontology including neuron specific ontology documentation.
