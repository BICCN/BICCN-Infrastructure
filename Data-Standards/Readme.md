## BICCN DATA STANDARDS
Data standards are being developed to support the BICCN. 

# TYPES OF STANDARDS
Standards may be developed for:
   - Requirements for types of data to be submitted   
   - Data formats
   - Minimal metadata requirements 
   - Technique or modality-specific requirements

# STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT
The development of standards needs to support the following:
   - BCDC requirements for data inventory and search
   - Archive needs for data storage, search, and organization
   - Re-use by the community
   - Relevant visualization tools planned for implementation across multiple datasets for the BICCN

It is a reality that standards continue to evolve, and may be influenced by efforts to integrate with other NIH-funded standards efforts and harmonization with other large consortium efforts.
