# Brain Image Library
## Description
The Brain Image Library (BIL) will support the goals of the BRAIN Initiative
Cell Census Network (BICCN) by providing a portal to the entire set of
images submitted by the participating BICCN labs.  High-performance
computational resources with high-bandwidth access to this library are
available both through BIL and the XSEDE program, and will allow analysis
of these datasets at scale.

# Roles
[Primary Investigator] Alex Ropelewski (ropelews@psc.edu)
[System Hardware/Software] Greg Hood (ghood@psc.edu)
[Website/Submission Portal] Luke Tuite (ltuite96@gmail.com)
[other names to be added shortly]

## Objectives
* Construct and operate a large-scale storage platform suitable for housing
  many thousands of image datasets totaling many petabytes in size.

* Host a metadata portal to allow searching through the metadata of
  these datasets.

* Host an image portal to allow rapid access to images from these datasets.

## In-scope
* Accept confocal microscopy image datasets from BICCN or other
  Brain Initiative laboratories

* Accept datasets of other types (e.g. neuron morphologies) that are derived
  from or relate to image datasets housed at BIL
 
* Provide Globus and FTP-based access to all public datasets

* Provide project-only access to BICCN collaborations, allowing members
  to share and operate on datasets prior to publication

* Provide stable DOIs that can be used in published literature to reference
  specific datasets or images

* Provide computational resources (such as VMs) on which users can run
  applications that operate directly on BIL-housed datasets

## Out-of-scope
* Performing registration or other analyses of datasets (though we do
  supply resources for users to do this themselves)
