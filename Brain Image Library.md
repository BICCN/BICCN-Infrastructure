# Brain Image Library
## Description
The Brain Image Library (BIL) is a national public resource enabling
researchers to deposit, analyze, mine, share, and interact with large brain
image datasets.  BIL encompasses the deposition of datasets, the integration
of datasets into a searchable web-accessible system, the redistribution of
datasets, and a computational enclave to allow researchers to process
datasets in-place and share restricted and pre-release datasets.  BIL is the
designated repository for microscopy data produced through the NIH BRAIN
Initiative.

## Objectives
* Permanent repository for high-quality brain microscopy datasets
    * Brain images of mouse, rat, human, other mammals and model organisms
    * Targeted experiments, including connectivity between cells and
      spatial transcriptomics (*FISH)
    * Historical collections

* Provide HPC computing capability local to the data for pre-submission
data processing and post-submission exploration
    * Enclave access to pre-release data
    * Research access to restricted-access, secured data

* Provide user access and support


## In-scope
* Accept original microscopy image datasets from investigators.  Provide text
for inclusion in Resource Sharing Plans.  There is no-charge to contribute
data to BIL or access BIL services.
* Accept higher-level datasets of other types (e.g. neuron morphologies) that
are derived from or relate to image datasets housed at BIL.
* Provide data-transfer support including network analysis to find transfer
bottlenecks, a lendable portable disk (BrainBall) device and the ability to
receive extremely large datasets directly on LTO-7/LTO-8 tapes.
* Provide download access to all public datasets.  Current supported
download methods include Globus and FTP.
* Provide project-only access to brain-initiative collaborations, allowing
collaborators to share and operate on datasets prior to publication.
* Provide stable DOIs that can be used in published literature to reference
specific datasets or images.
* Provide computational resources on which users can run applications that
operate directly on BIL-housed datasets.
* Host custom portals that can operate directly on BIL-housed datasets.
* Collaborate with investigators on establishing standardized formats,
pipelines, APIs, and services that can be adopted and/or made available through
BIL.


## Out-of-scope
* Performing analyses for users (e.g. registration or other analyses of
datasets)
