# BRAIN Cell Data Center
## Description
The BRAIN Cell Data Center (BCDC) will support the goals of the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN) by providing a foundational community resource for housing single-cell centered data content in the brain. We will lead, together with BICCN data generation partners, in the development and deployment of fundamental data models, common community standards, data, and scientific results to improve our understanding of the diverse cell types in the mammalian brain and its organizational logic. 

# Roles
[Primary Investigator] Lydia Ng (lydian@alleninstitute.org)
[Primary Investigator] Michael Hawrylycz (mikeh@alleninstitute.org)
[Metadata standards and Data Wrangling] Carol Thompson (carolth@alleninstitute.org)   
[Grant and Consortium Administration] Florence D'Orazi (florence.dorazi@alleninstitute.org)   

## Definitions [Optional]
CCF: The CCF is the "common coordinate framework", a three-dimensional coordinate space corresponding to mouse brain to be used as a standard reference for anatomical coordinates. 

## Objectives
- Develop a data collection, quantification, and mapping framework for managing data and information across diverse repositories.
- Host a web portal to provide information about the consortium, enable users to find useful datasets, and direct users to raw data at archives.
- Facilitate consortium communications and collaboration. 
- Serve as a "data archive" for extracted features suitable for search and navigation in the web portal.

## In-scope
- Manage metadata standards and achieve community alignment.
- Develop policies, processes and infrastructure to support metadata collection and management.
- Provide centralized inventory reporting for raw data at R24s.
- Develop and maintain web portal for basic information about the consortium.
- Provide searchable metadata for consortium datasets.
- Host more advanced data search and navigation for a subset of experiments including both metadata and extracted features.
- Support CCF mapping through the provision of instructions and tools to data generation centers.
- Support centralization of communications. 
- Organize collaboration opportunities through BCDC-sponsored workshops and face-to-face meetings.

## Out-of-scope
- Performing CCF mapping for data generators.
- Providing advanced visualization for all datasets.

# Communication
- Communication channels will be added as appropriate.
