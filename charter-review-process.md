# Charter Review Process  
This is the current process for having a charter reviewed and approved by the Infrastructure Working Group (IWG). This is a living document, improvements are welcome. Please raise them to the IWG.   

## Make a Charter  
Please make a charter. Please use [this template](https://github.com/BICCN/BICCN-Infrastructure-Draft/blob/master/charter-template.md). The charter should be submitted as a PR. Here are instructions to make a [PR](https://github.com/BICCN/BICCN-Infrastructure-Draft/blob/master/creating-a-charter-for-review.md).

## Select Reviewers  
Please add at least 2 reviewers to your charter to be reviewed. These should be named individuals from currently approved charters.  

## Announce the charter  
Please announce the charter at the next Infrastructure Working Group (IWG) Meeting. During this time (and throughout the process), IWG members should be encouraged to add themselves as reviewers.  

## Review period  
The review period starts at the announcement of the charter in a IWG meeting and is concluded in the next IWG meeting. During this time please use GitHub to make comments and reviews. All comments and reviews should be addressed by the charter author before the next IWG meeting.  

## Charter Approval
After the review period, charters are given a final brief discussion in the IWG meeting. During this time the IWG group will asked to approve the charter. For a charter to be approved, all reviewers on the charter must approve at this time. During this time any IWG member may ask for the charter to not be approved or for the review to be extended as long as specific concerns that the author can address are cited. Any charter not approved may be edited and go back through the review process or be withdrawn at the discretion of the charter author.      

## New Charter Status
After approval, the PR is merged and the charter is official. The charter can be updated and changed as needed using this same process.
