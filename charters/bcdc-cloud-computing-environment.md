# BCDC Cloud Computing Environment (Terra)
## Description
We connect, develop, add value to, and train our community around the BCDC Cloud Computing Environment. This is a cloud-native environment that enables many functionality including cloud storage, scalable data processing pipelines, and horizontally scalable data-science environments.

# Roles
[Principal Investigator] Timothy Tickle (ttickle@broadinstitute.org)   
[Pipelines Development Product Manager] Kylee Degatano (email@email.com)   
[Customer Success and Education] Salin Thomas (salin@broadinstitute.org)  
[Project Manager] Cara Mason (cara@broadinstiute.org)

## Definitions
*pipeline:* A collection of one or more functional tasks that operate on input data and, from that, transform the input data, or derive features often used to interpret the input data. In a high throughput setting, these tasks are often automated to be performed in a batch setting.

## Objectives
- To create and maintain a cloud native, horizontally scalable environment for use by the BICCN Community.   
- To work with community member to bring data processing pipelines used by the community or of value to the community into the cloud computing envrinment so they may be operated at scale.   

## In-scope
- Connect data flow from BICCN Ingest services and archives to the BCDC Cloud Computing Environment to enable the processing of sequence-based data.   
- Work with community members to translate community pipelines and pipelines of high value to cloud-native, horizontally scalable data processing pipelines.   
- Perform training on how to use the BCDC Cloud Computing Environment to BICCN community members, those wanting to process consortium data, and those who want to use a consortium derived pipeline (on private or public data).

## Out-of-scope
- Data operations or processing data on behalf of the BICCN community.   
- Running or maintaining pipelines not compatible with the BICCN cloud computing environment.
