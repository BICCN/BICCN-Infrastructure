# Policy regarding support of data and resource citation and use of persistent identifiers

## For data submitters/authors

### Persistent identifiers + metadata for BICCN datasets
- BICCN consortium members will submit their data to an approved BRAIN repository for publication.  
- Datasets must include a standard set of metadata specified by the BICCN (TODO:  Get list from Carol)
- Repositories will issue persistent identifiers (PIDs) required by many journals for referencing a dataset in a publication. 
- If submitted data are to be included in a manuscript, make sure that you consult with the repository to understand how long it takes for data ingest, validation and PID assignment. (TODO:  Reference charter location)

### Data and resource citation policy for BICCN

- **Citing BICCN/BRAIN tools, including the data archives**: We will adopt the use of Research Resource Identifiers (RRID), supported by many journals and widely used across biomedicine.  [RRIDs](https://scicrunch.org/resources) are persistent identifiers for different types of tools-digital resources, antibodies, organisms, cell lines, biosamples and plasmids, that can be used to identify and track the resources used in a scientific paper.  RRIDs appear in the materials and methods section in the following form:  "Data was deposited into the NEMO data archive (RRID:SCR_016152)".  A list of RRIDs for BRAIN supported archives and tools is maintained by the [Neuroscience Information Framework](https://neuinfo.org//).  Note that many of these resources also request that authors include a citation to a publication describing the resource.

- **Citing data deposited in an archive**:  Authors should cite data sets in a manner similar to citing other papers, as per the the [Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles](https://www.force11.org/datacitationprinciples).  A data citation contains the following information:  authors, date published, title, version, repository, persistent identifier.  

- The data set is cited in the manuscript using the required style, e.g., "Data (Martone et al., 2019) was deposited into the NEMO data archive (RRID:SCR_016152)" 

- The data citation can be listed in the data availability statement:  Martone et al., 2019

- The full citation should be included in the references:  Martone, ME (2019) My data set, V2.0, Neuroscience Multiomics Data Archive, doi:hzi.12345.

- Many journals are formally implementing data citation (e.g., [Nature Scientific Data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0026-5) although it is still early days, but BICCN should be leading the way to making sure that our data is identified, credited and trackable.  

## Requirements/recommendations for archives/repositories

### Persistent identifiers
  - Each respository will provision persistent identifiers for data sets and other research objects 
  - PIDs will resolve to landing pages with rich metadata describing the data set and how to cite it (see example) 
  - Appropriate PID schemes are described in (TODO: reference other document when it is ready)
  - While data archives are not encouraged to invent their own identifiers, should they do so they should conform to best practices for creating persistent identifiers, e.g., [Ten Simple Rules for design, provision and reuse of persistent identifiers](https://github.com/stain/identifier-rules).
  - Repositories should provide for the facility for users to create collections of files/data sets and mint new identifiers/metadata that describe them
  - Each repository will add their policy on identifiers in their charters and on their web pages
  - Each repository will add information on their persistence policy, as required by the FAIR and Data Citation Principles, to ensure that the PIDs will continue to resolve to metadata even if the underlying data is no longer available.  

### Resource citation
  - Each resource (data or software) produced by BICCN will receive an RRID  
  - Each repository will encourage the use of the appropriate RRID when citing use of the resource
  - Suggested language:  When using this resources, please cite Publication X and include the following the Research Resource Identifier in the materials and methods: RRID:SCR_016152
  - RRIDs can be requested or found through the [Neuroscience Information Framework](https://neuinfo.org//) or the [RRID Portal](https://scicrunch.org/resources)
    
  
### Data citation
- Each repository should provide a FAIR landing page for each data set that includes the majority of elements from the [dkNET Rich Metadata](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E1fA2AJDvvmxlS8g8yvpnt6BIayvZVOR7dMYe-hWIiU/edit#heading=h.z356s1so2kcy) recommendations
- For each data set, the resource shall provide a full data citation as part of the landing page of the form:  
  -- authors, date published, title, version, repository, identifier
  -- For more information on implementing data citation, please see [Fenner et al. (2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0031-8)
