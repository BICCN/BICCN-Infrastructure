# Policy regarding support of data and resource citation and use of persistent identifiers

## Data citation
- Each repository should provide a FAIR landing page for each data set that includes the majority of elements from the [dkNET Rich Metadata](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E1fA2AJDvvmxlS8g8yvpnt6BIayvZVOR7dMYe-hWIiU/edit#heading=h.z356s1so2kcy) recommendations
- For each data set, the resource shall provide a full data citation as part of the landing page of the form:  
  -- authors, date published, title, version, repository, identifier

## Resource citation
  - Each resource (data or software) produced by BICCN will receive an RRID  
  - Each repository will encourage the use of the appropriate RRID when citing use of the resource
  
## Persistent identifiers
  - Each respository will provision persistent identifiers for data sets and other research objects 
  - PIDs will resolve to landing pages with rich metadata describing the data set and how to cite it
  - Appropriate PID schemes are described in (TODO: reference other document when it is ready)
  - While data archives are not encouraged to invent their own identifiers, should they do so they should conform to best practices for creating persistent identifiers, e.g., [Ten Simple Rules for design, provision and reuse of persistent identifiers](https://github.com/stain/identifier-rules).
  - Repositories should provide for the facility for users to create collections of files/data sets and mint new identifiers/metadata that describe them
  - Each repository will add their policy on identifiers in their charters and on their web pages
  - Each repository will add information on their persistence policy, as required by the FAIR and Data Citation Principles, to ensure that the PIDs will continue to resolve to metadata even if the underlying data is no longer available.
