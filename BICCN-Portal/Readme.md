This is a repository for templates to submit information for inclusion on the BICCN portal.
Currently there are two templates available. 

TEAM PAGES
Each team page correspondes to a grant that has full or affiliate membership in the BICCN. This template provides a place to include an image,title, a description of the grant, and the leadership and affiliation. Directions are included in the template.

TOOL PAGES
Tool descriptions that were generated with the BICCN community or are in heavy usage by the BICCN community can be included on the portal with an image, as well as a brief description and URLs.
